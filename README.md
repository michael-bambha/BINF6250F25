# BINF6250: Bioinformatics Algorithms

## Description

This repository contains several projects that I worked on over the course of taking BINF6250 at Northeastern University.

### Project 1: Simple VCF Parsing + Intro to Asynchronous Collaboration with Git/GitHub

### Project 2: Markov Chains

### Project 3: Gibbs Sampling

### Project 4: Graph Algorithms (De Bruijn Graphs)

### Project 5: Dynamic Programming (Smith-Waterman)

### Project 6: Tree Building Algorithms (Neighbor-Joining)

### Project 7: Combinatorial Algorithms (Burrows-Wheeler Transform)

### Project 8: Hidden Markov Models (Forward, Backward, Forward-Backward, Viterbi, Baum-Welch)
